Welcome to our game CaRPG

Some general info about the Gameplay

1.Currently the opponent does their action before the current obstacle. To see their car's current gear level refer to the console where it will be printed

2.The console will tell the player the current obstacle and the requirements to succeed. The image in the top right is also in reference to the current obstacle

IMPORTANT : both these elements will be transitioned into in engine display methods. Currently these are placeholders for certain elements due to time constraints

3.Once both cars come to a stop the player may take as much time planning their strategy as they want. On the player's turn they can do a total of two actions (unless the current obstacle is a chicane (S curve) in which case they get one action)

4. Actions vary from playing a card, accelerating/braking (this is done by clicking the pedals located in the bottom left corner), or shifting gears (this is done via clicking and dragging the red lever toward the up position or the down position). Swapping between accelerate and brake also consumes one action.

5. For the player to shift up a gear they need to be accelerating, and braking to shift down a gear

6. For every obstacle a victor will be decided. After the player uses both their action the game will print the victor in the console, and then increase their score. (this will also be transfered to a HUD element later in development)

7. Once all obstacles are complete the game will see whether the player or their opponent has the higher score and then print it to the console. The winner will also be clear visually

8. The player is controlling the red car
