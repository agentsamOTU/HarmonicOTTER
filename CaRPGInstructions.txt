Some general info about the Gameplay

1.Currently the opponent does their action before the current obstacle. To see their car's current gear level refer to the gearbox in the bottom left

2.The top right will tell the player the current obstacle and the requirements to succeed. The image in the top right is also in reference to the current obstacle

3.Once both cars come to a stop the player may take as much time planning their strategy as they want. On the player's turn they can do a total of two actions (unless the current obstacle is a chicane (S curve) in which case they get one action)

4. Actions vary from playing a card or accelerating/braking (this is done by clicking the two pedals located in the bottom left corner)
