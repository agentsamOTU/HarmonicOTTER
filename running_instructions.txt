To run the demo first run premake_build.bat
If running the program from inside VS please change the configuration to release at the top, otherwise you can use the executable in the bin folder
The game may crash unexpectedly near the beginning and this error is being looked into. It seems to be random however and the game is 100% playable.
Please read the CaRPGInstructions.txt document within the zipped folder.
